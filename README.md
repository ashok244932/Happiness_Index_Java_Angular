# happiness_index

Our project is an implementation of the Happiness Index calculation, using the Java programming language with the Spring Boot framework in the backend, and Angular in the frontend. The project is aimed at allowing users to input data about their daily activities and moods, and to calculate their happiness index based on the data.

In the backend, we used the Spring Boot framework with the H2 database to build a RESTful API that allows the frontend to retrieve and manipulate data. 

In the frontend, we used Angular to create a modern, responsive user interface. The frontend communicates with the backend API to retrieve and display user data. We used various libraries in the frontend, including Angular Material for UI components and chart.js for data visualization.
